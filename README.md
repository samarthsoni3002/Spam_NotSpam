# Spam_NotSpam

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing project implemented using python. 
The model predicts whether the message is spam or not by flagging it with 0 and 1.

# Project Overview
The model is implemented using NLP techniques. 
It is built to tackle the problem of email classification. 
It is trained on dataset containing labelled examples of Spam and Ham. 

# Future Imporvements
To implement the model on an Email service. 
To increase the efficiency using Recurrent Neural Netowrks or the architecture Long Short term memory.
